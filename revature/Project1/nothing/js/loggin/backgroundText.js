    var sentence = "I learned allot in this project, I failded I chilled, I learned, and after seeing the breif presentations on friday became excited about writing nice good clean code. I Shannon led the way with nice clean looking code, and good funtionality, and Carl had allot of great use cases of validation. Sara showed us more of what was possible with SQL, and moved the bar a little higher. I enjoyed John's presentation, it was nice to see someone trying and reminding us that we are all here to learn, help eachother and improve. I was distracted by the new people our new trainer allot of things. I had a stalker from california visit me, which gave me nightmares for a couple of days, my friend broke up with me I was sad I kind of cried a couple of days. I made a new friend, and we all faied together. Let them stroke their egos. I'm here I love you all. I think you all are great in your own little way. I learned allot from the first round of code and am glad I didn't get a chance to present, initally my code was ðŸ’© very unorganized and all over the place. I would have had an easier time had I known its not in anyones interest to run two servets that compete for reasources and cause all sorts of bugs. Litterally one time I closed my computer and opened it and the loggin functionallity broke. It had been working for 4 days, I hadn't changed anything that would have touched that code but still it just kept breaking and breaking i was ilke wtf... this makes no sense. When i would try and place simple javascript methods on imported objects from ajax I almost always  gpt an error if i tried to do anything other than console.log(); anyway the point is don't try do launch xampp and springtools suite at the same time the moment I realized that my project completion could finally move out of thinking that I was doing something wrong when instead I was just imaging different ways to do the ame thing. god iT waS a verY streSSFul weeK I caNT belIeVe It Was ThE fouRTH thATS MY LItlE SisStERS BITHRDAY AND ALL I KNOW IS I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I HATE JAVA I HATE OOP I DONT WANT TO DECLARE A VARIABLE I DONT LIKE PASSING OBJECTS I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I CANNOT I WILL NOT BE THE SAME I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I DO thiS FOR YOU My roomaTE turnED ouT tO bE CraZY My FRieND Doe nOT HAVe anY SENSe of sELF I Do noT KnoW What I am GoinG To DO WIthOUT YOU ALL I kNOW IS THAT I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I HATE JAVA I HATE JAVA I HATE JAVA I HATE JAVA I HATE I+JAVA I HATE JAVA I HAVE JAVE I HATE JAVE I HATE JAVA I HATE JAVA I HATE JAVA I HAD JAVA I HAD JAVA I HATE JAVA I LIKE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LIKE JAVA I LIKE HATE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LOAVE HATE JAVA I HATE JAVA JA IA AVA LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LOVE HAVA I HAVE JAVA I LOVE JAVA I LIKE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LOVE JAVA I LIKE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I LOVE JAVA I HATE JAVA I DON'T UNDERSTAND SERVLETS TO SAVE MY LIFE I DIDNM'T UPDESTAND JAVA TO SAVE MY LIFE SERVLETS SAVED MY LIFE I HATE JAVA I LOVE JAVA FRONT CONTROLLERS AND OTHER STUFF TOO THIS WEEKEND I SPENT MY SUNDAY ELATED OVER THAT LITTLE SEMICOLON SARA HELPED ME FINE IN MY CODE MY BOY FRIEND ALREADY WENT OVER THE SAME MISTAKES I MADE ON THIS PROJECT IN THE ALST PROJECT HE WAS IKE DID NOT WE GO OVER THESE ERRORS?
