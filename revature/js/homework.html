///although this not a problem if you knwoingly want greeter two to be redefined, it becomes a problem when you do not

let is preferred for variable declaration
let is considered blcok scope.

let greeter Three = "hey hi";

let can be updated but not redeclared.
let can be updated but not redeclared. 


however if some variable is defined in different scopes, 
//there will be no error. 


var can be redeclared. 
var can be redeclared.


why no error?
both instances are treated as different variables since they have different scopes.

When using let you don't have to bother if you have used a na,e
for a variable before, as a variable exisits only within its scope
also since a let variable cannot be declared more than once within a scope
then the problem discussed earlier that occurs with var does not occur.

/*
hoisting of let

just like var, let declarations are hoisted to the top.
unlike var which is initialized as undefined, the let keyword
is not initialized so if you try and use a let variable 
before declaration you'll get a reference error.

/*

const 

variables declared with the const maintain const values.

const variables are blocked scope

const variables cannot be updated or redeclared.unless they are arrays.

 5. Balanced Brackets

 A bracket is any one of the following: (, ), {, }, [, or ]

 The following are NOT balanced brackets:
 (

 (()
 ([)]

 Return true if balanced
